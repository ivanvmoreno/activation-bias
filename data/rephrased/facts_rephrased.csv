Comets are icy celestial objects that orbit the Sun.,1,"Comets can be characterized as fascinating and icy celestial bodies that traverse the vastness of space, following intricate, elongated orbits around the Sun, and are often composed of a mixture of frozen gases, dust, and rocky materials that may become visually spectacular when they approach our star due to the sublimation of their ice and the resulting formation of glowing comas and tails."
